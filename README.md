Code Competency Puzzles

Introduction
You are given the choice of solving either a set of three small puzzles ("Choice A") or solving one larger puzzle
("Choice B").

Choice A - Puzzle One – Reverse Words
Write a function to reverse the words in a string, for example “cat and dog” becomes “tac dna god”.
t a C d n a g o d
C a t a n d d o g
Please do not use any string manipulation functions that you do not implement yourself.
Your code
• Should reverse each word within the string without altering whitespace characters
• Should treat punctuation characters as part of the word
• Is only required to deal with standard English characters. Unicode support is not required.
• Should be your own code and should not use any built-in .NET string manipulation calls.


Choice A - Puzzle Two – Linked list
Write a function that would return the 5th element from the tail (or end) of a singly linked list of integers.
For example, given the list 2 -> 3 -> 4 ->5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 10 -> 11 your function would return 7.
Your code
• Should return the 5th element from the tail in a single pass.
• Should be your own code and should not use any built-in .NET collection components.


Choice A - Puzzle Three - Triangles
Write a function that receives three integer inputs for the lengths of the sides of a triangle and returns one of four
values to determine the triangle type: scalene, isosceles, equilateral or error.
Equilateral
Three equal sides
Isosceles
Two equal sides
Scalene
